                    Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of
                    writing numbers
                    throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers are written with combinations of letters
                    from the
                    Latin alphabet, each letter with a fixed integer value. Modern style uses only these seven:

                    Roman numerals of course were widely used for a shit ton of purposes, but one of the coolest in my
                    opinion is the
                    legion number, in the Roman legions, numerals were used to denote the legion number, the cohort
                    number, and the century number.
                    The Roman military structure was highly organized and hierarchical, and numerals played a crucial
                    role in identifying and
                    organizing different units.
                </p>
                <ul id="legion-numerals">
                    <li class="li-header">Legion Number:</li>
                    <p>
                        The Roman legions were numbered with Roman numerals, typically from I to XXX (1 to 30). Each
                        legion had its own
                        unique numeral designation, and this numeral was an essential part of the legion's identity. For
                        example,
                        Legio III Augusta represented the third legion, and Legio X Fretensis represented the tenth
                        legion.
                    </p>
                    <li class="li-header">Cohort Number:</li>
                    <p>
                        Legions were subdivided into cohorts, and each cohort was assigned a specific numeral. A legion
                        typically had ten cohorts, and the cohort numerals ranged from I to X. For instance, in Legio
                        III Augusta, the first cohort would be Cohors I, the second Cohors II, and so on.
                    </p>
                    <li class="li-header">Century Number:</li>
                    <p>
                        The basic tactical unit within a Roman legion was the century, which consisted of approximately
                        80 to 100 men. Centuries were numbered within each cohort using Roman numerals. The first
                        century of the first cohort, for example, would be known as Centuria I, while the second century
                        of the second cohort would be Centuria II.
